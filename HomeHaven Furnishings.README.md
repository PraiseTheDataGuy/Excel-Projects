**KEY METRICS: **
Total Revenue: $2.5M
Total Profit: $2.2M
Total Orders: 1,938

**KEY INSIGHTS:**

**Sales Overview:**
The Bedroom and Living Room furnitures are the top 2 categories by revenue generated, closely followed by Kitchen, while demands vary differently across brands with Homegoods and Overstock jointly leading the way. If some sort of collaboration between bedroom furnitures and either of the most in demand brand can be done, a spike in sales might be a result.

80% of the customers added were new customers, which can be attibuted to the one-time purchase nature of the product and a testament to the marketing reach of  the company

Overstock is the brand with the highest product price, yet they led in demands. It shows their favorability among the customers, likely due to the quality of their products.

**Logistics:**
The average shipping cost among the brands at HomeHaven Furnishings was $68. The total shipping cost was around $130K+
The average delivery window was 8 days

The cost of shipping varied by brand, but they were generally within the same range, suggesting no advantage over any brand regarding the shipping costs.

Less than one-third of the total orders required assembly service. The data shows that the orders who had issues with their delivery were majorly those who requested assembly service. Dissappointments as a result of cancelled orders or failed delivery or rescheduled orders might drive away potential customera]s, if the assembly service delivery can be improved, it might raise the customers trust in the company.

**Customer Service**
Crate&Barrel and Target are the two brands with the largest difference between the cancelled orders and delivered orders, indicating considerable chances of getting your products delivered by both brands than any other.

Target is the best rated brand, their customer treatment can be studied by other brands as to what makes them get better ratings compared to other brands. Understanding the reasons behind their good ratings can be key to unlocking a better customer-brand relationship

**CONCLUSION**
This analysis shows a comprehensive overview of the company's sales, logistics and customer service. The insights derived would be applicable in generating more revenue for the company and can be a means to generate opportunities to maximize sales and company growth especially through customer's preferences.
